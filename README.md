# (C++) Cracking the Coding Interview - 6th Edition
Interview Preparation

All questions were completed in under ~00:45:00 - 01:00:00 time limit

*Recommend learning more on www.geeksforgeeks.org/ for tries, heaps, etc. which are not covered enough in CTCI*

Helpful test case definitions that you can apply to testing your algorithms:

# How I Approached these Problems

1. Read the problem carefully and think about what it's asking for
2. Get a piece of notebook paper
3. Draw a diagram and write down pseudo-code
4. Go through multiple examples and test your pseudo-code with those examples
5. Translate your pseudo-code to actual code
6. Always test code for edge, boundary, corner, and base cases
7. If stuck on a solution for more than one hour, do not read the code, but read the hints/approaches
8. From reading those hints/approaches, try to translate them to pseudo-code then to actual code

Optimized question asked by Amazon in a Software Engineer Interview. If done without <strings>
it would require multiple tedious implementations of concatenation from digits to char.
