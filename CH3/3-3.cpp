/*
- Stack of Plates -
Imagine a literaly stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
exceeds some threshold. Implement a datastructure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack
once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetofStacks.pop()
shold behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same
values as it would if there were just a single stack.)

FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific
sub-stack.
