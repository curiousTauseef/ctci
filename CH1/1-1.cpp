/*
1.1
Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
	   What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Hints: #44, #117, #132

44: Try a hash table

117: Could a bit vector be useful?

132: Can you solve it in O(n * log(n)) time? What might a solution like that look like?
