/*
- String Compression -
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. 

For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string,
your method should return the original string.

You can assume the strnig has only uppercase and lowercase letters
(a -z).

- Hints -

#92: Do the easy thing first: compress the string, then compare lengths.

#110: Be careful that you aren't repeatedly concatenating strings
together. This can be very inefficient.

#include <iostream>

{
	char str1[12] = "aabcccccaaa";

	return 0;
