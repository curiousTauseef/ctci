/*
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string.

EXAMPLE
Input:  "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

HINTS
#53: It's often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning

#118: You might find out that you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count them?
