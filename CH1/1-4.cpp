/*
- Palindrome Permutation - 
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards & backwards.
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be
limited to just dictionary words. (ASCII - 128 or 256 for extended)
