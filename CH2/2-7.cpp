/*
- INTERSECTION -
Given 2 linked lists, determine if the 2 lists intersect.
Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection
is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the
k'th node of the 1st linked list is the exact same node
(by reference) as the j'th node of the 2nd linked list, 
then they are intersecting.

- HINTS-
#20, 45, 55, 65, 76, 93, 111, 120, 129
