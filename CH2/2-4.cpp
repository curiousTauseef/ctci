/*
- Partition -
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater
than or equal to x. The partition element x can appear
anywhere in the "right position"; it does not need to
appear between the left and right partitions.

- EXAMPLE -
1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 (x = 3)
1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

- HINTS -
#3, #24
