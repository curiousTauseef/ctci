/*
- SUM LISTS -
You have 2 numbers represented by a linked list, where each node
contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order,
such that the 1's digit is at the head of hte list. Write a
function that adds the 2 numbers and returns the sum as a linked
list.

- EXAMPLE -
Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.

- FOLLOW UP -
Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above
pattern.

- EXAMPLE -
Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295.
Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912.

- HINTS -
#7,30,71,95,109
