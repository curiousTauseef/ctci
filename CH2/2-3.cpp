/*
- Delete Middle Node -
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
(i.e., any node but the first and last node, not
necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list,
given only access to that node.

- EXAMPLE -
Input: (node c) a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
Output: Nothing returned, but new list is a -> b -> d -> e -> f

- HINTS -
